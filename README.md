# Cheating Gall's Law

Or, how we split a monolith and lived to tell the tale. This is the story of how npm replaced its monolithic registry service with microservices. We rolled out the registry without any users noticing this huge change behind the scenes. How did we manage this? What did we mess up? What can you learn from our experience?
